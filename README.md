## A Basic Image Classifier on CIFAR10 using CNNs in PyTorch
Classifies a 32x32 size RGB image into 10 different categories - 'plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'
I have two Convolutional Layers and a 2x2 MaxPooling layer after each one with 6 channels and another with 16 channels.
After which I have two intermidiate Linear layers of sizes 120 and 84 and finally output layer of size 10
